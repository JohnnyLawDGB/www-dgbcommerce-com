        <p class="NoMargin">DGB Commerce is an initiative by <a href="https://github.com/LeroyGerrits"
                target="_blank">Leroy Gerrits</a>, a full-stack web developer and former business owner from the
            Netherlands. Being disappointed by the lack of utility and real life use cases for <a
                href="https://www.digibyte.io" target="_blank">Digibyte</a>, and having many years of experience with
            e-commerce
            solutions and <abbr title="Software As A Service">SAAS</abbr> platforms, he put two and two together and
            decided to create more utility for Digibyte in the form of DGB Commerce.</p>
        <p>While there are existing means for merchants to offer their products and get paid with Digibyte, most of them
            exist in the form of plugins/add-ons/components for third-party software, charge hefty fees, are cumbersome
            to use and/or require at least some technical know-how to implement. With DGB Commerce, that threshold is
            gone and merchants can fully focus on their products and sales once more.</p>
