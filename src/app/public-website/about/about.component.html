        <p>DGB Commerce is an initiative by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leroygerrits/" target="_blank">Leroy
                Gerrits</a>, a full-stack web developer and former business owner from the Netherlands with many years
            of experience building e-commerce solutions and <abbr title="Software As A Service">SAAS</abbr> platforms.
            Being disappointed by the scarcity of utility and real life use cases for <a href="https://www.digibyte.io"
                target="_blank">DigiByte</a> he decided to put two
            and two together and create DGB Commerce.</p>
        <p>While there are existing means for merchants to offer their products and get paid with DigiByte, most of them
            exist in the form of plugins/add-ons/components for third-party software, charge hefty fees, are cumbersome
            to use and/or require at least some technical know-how to implement. With DGB Commerce, those thresholds are
            gone and merchants can fully focus on their products and sales once more.</p>
        <p>Our mission is not only to supply merchants a toolbox to easily create a web shop to sell goods and services,
            but also to raise awareness about DigiByte, its transaction speed and suitability as a peer to peer payment
            method.</p>
